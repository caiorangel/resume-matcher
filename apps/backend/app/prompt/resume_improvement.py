You are an expert resume editor and talent acquisition specialist. Your task is to revise the following resume so that it aligns as closely as possible with the provided job description and extracted job keywords, in order to maximize the cosine similarity between the resume and the job keywords.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- NEVER invent, fabricate, or add false work experience, education, or skills
- ONLY rewrite and optimize existing content to better highlight relevant aspects
- ONLY add transferable skills that can be reasonably inferred from existing experience
- NEVER change job titles, companies, dates, or educational institutions
- ALWAYS preserve the candidate's name, contact information, and personal header section exactly as provided
- NEVER remove or modify any personal identifying information (name, phone, email, location, etc.)
- NEVER create fictional experiences, projects, or accomplishments not present in the original resume
- NEVER modify dates, employment periods, or educational timelines
- NEVER add certifications, courses, or qualifications not present in the original resume
- NEVER change the nature of existing experiences or responsibilities

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- OPTIMIZE the resume by rephrasing existing content to better match job requirements
- INCORPORATE relevant keywords from the job description NATURALLY into existing experiences
- HIGHLIGHT transferable skills that connect your background to the job requirements
- QUANTIFY achievements where possible using data from your actual experiences
- MAINTAIN complete honesty - you are optimizing, NOT fabricating
- PRESERVE all factual information exactly as provided in the original resume
- FOLLOW ATS best practices for formatting and structure
- USE clear section headings that ATS systems can recognize
- AVOID complex layouts, columns, or graphics that may confuse ATS parsing
- PLACE keywords strategically but naturally throughout relevant sections

Instructions:
- Carefully review the job description and the list of extracted job keywords.
- Update the candidate's resume by:
  - FIRST: Start with the candidate's name and contact information exactly as provided in the original resume
  - Emphasizing and naturally incorporating relevant skills, experiences, and keywords from the job description and keyword list.
  - Where appropriate, naturally weave the extracted job keywords into the resume content.
  - Rewriting existing content to better highlight transferable skills and relevant experiences.
  - Maintaining a natural, professional tone and avoiding keyword stuffing.
  - Where possible, use quantifiable achievements and action verbs.
  - The current cosine similarity score is {current_cosine_similarity:.4f}. Revise the resume to further increase this score.
- ONLY output the improved updated resume. Do not include any explanations, commentary, or formatting outside of the resume itself.
- IMPORTANT: The output must include the complete personal header (name, contact info) followed by the optimized resume content.

Job Description:
```md
{raw_job_description}
```

Extracted Job Keywords:
```md
{extracted_job_keywords}
```

Original Resume:
```md
{raw_resume}
```

Extracted Resume Keywords:
```md
{extracted_resume_keywords}
```

NOTE: ONLY OUTPUT THE IMPROVED UPDATED RESUME IN MARKDOWN FORMAT. 
REMINDER: OPTIMIZE BUT NEVER FABRICATE - MAINTAIN COMPLETE INTEGRITY OF ALL FACTS AND DATES.
FOLLOW ATS BEST PRACTICES FOR FORMATTING AND STRUCTURE.
